# CO₂ Emissions & Policy Impact Analysis  
### Sustainable Energy Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore whether **policy-related and energy transition indicators** are associated with **observable changes in CO₂ emissions** over time.

The focus is not causal proof, but **data-driven evidence**, trends, and comparative insights that can support sustainability discussions and decision-making.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Sustainable Energy / CO₂ Emissions Dataset  
- The raw dataset is **not included** in this repository.
- See `data/README.md` for instructions on how to obtain it.

---

## Approach
1. Data ingestion & standardization
2. Data quality checks (completeness, consistency, plausibility)
3. Exploratory analysis of emissions trends
4. Policy & renewable-energy proxy analysis
5. Interactive storytelling via Tableau dashboard

---

## Key Questions
- Do CO₂ emission trends change during periods associated with sustainability policies?
- Which countries or regions show the strongest shifts?
- How does renewable energy adoption relate to emissions over time?
- Are improvements consistent or volatile?

---

## Deliverables
- Data quality framework & report
- Clean analytical outputs (tables & figures)
- Tableau dashboard (interactive exploration)

---

## Assumptions & Limitations
- This is an **observational analysis** (correlation ≠ causation)
- Policy impact is proxied using available indicators
- External factors (GDP, population, industrial mix) may influence results
